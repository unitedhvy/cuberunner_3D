Java Class Final Project - Make Your Own Educational Game

CubeRunner 3D
The game involves the user navigating through a 3D space, dodging cubes (similar to 
the game CubeRunner, but with an added ability to move up and down in addition to left and right - a first the x dimension, then depth, or z, and in CubeRunner 3D, also the y) 
Questions appear at the top right of the screen, and the user is not required to answer
them, but does recieve a large bonus in points for answering, making question-answering 
more lucrative than navigating cubes. Though the game is not divided into distinct levels, the timer implementation allows the game to incrementally get harder as the user progresses.Further instructions are avaliable in-game.
